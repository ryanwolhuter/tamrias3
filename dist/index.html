            <p>Swirling, cinematic sound-design techniques

            <h1>The Cave</h1>

            <p>"The first time working with Tamrias,
              we found some really cool beads in the studio
              and tried sampling them and found we could make a really
              creepy sounding background which reminded us both a lot of a cave.</p>

            <p>From there she put down an impromptu piano part
              and we had a friend come in and record some melodic lines
              and extended techniques on viola. </p>

            <p>I did most of the processing and sound design to bring our cave to life.</p>
