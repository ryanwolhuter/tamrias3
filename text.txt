            <p>Tamrias is a classically-trained
              electro-acoustic musician and producer
              currently based in Cape Town,
              South Africa.</p>

            <p>Her debut album, titled 'New Leaf' is a deep,
              reflective expedition into the unknown.</p>

            <p>Swirling, cinematic sound-design techniques
              and cut-up glitch-esque electronics swim amidst
              colourful composition, with sampled loops and
              naturally occurring soundscapes.</p>

            <h1>The Cave</h1>

            <p>"The first time working with Tamrias,
              we found some really cool beads in the studio
              and tried sampling them and found we could make a really
              creepy sounding background which reminded us both a lot of a cave.</p>

            <p>From there she put down an impromptu piano part
              and we had a friend come in and record some melodic lines
              and extended techniques on viola. </p>

            <p>I did most of the processing and sound design to bring our cave to life.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm a nervous wreck until I get behind the decks.
          All I give a fuck about is Ableton and sex</p>

        <p>If you met me, you'd probably say 'Hi'
          and I don't have a problem with that. Yet.</p>

        <p>If you're thinking about giving me money, just
          fucking do it already.</p>

        <p>I live off chocolate, sleeping pills, and weed. Will
          accept payment in money or all of the above</p>

        <p>I'm Ryan's favourite friend. He loves me, and
          you should too.</p>

        <p>Seriously gimme some fuckin money.</p>
